    # Constructor
    # -----------
    # Called when the classifier is first created.

    # Function: Train
    # -------------
    # Given a set of training images, and a number of centroids
    # to learn k,
    # calculate any information you will need in order to make 
    # predictions in the testing phase. This function will be
    # called only once. Your training must feature select!

        # in the first two parts of the assignment.

        # able to use the extractFeatures method that you wrote.

        ### YOUR CODE HERE ###

        # As an example, we can extract features for an image
        # like so:
        exampleImage = trainImages[0]
        myFeatures = self.featureLearner.extractFeatures(exampleImage)      


        ### YOUR CODE HERE ###

        self.trained = True

    # Function: Test
    # -------------
    # Given a set of testing images
    # calculate a list of predictions for those images. You
    # may assume that the train function has already been called. 
    # This function will be called multiple times.
    def test(self, testImages):
        assert self.trained

        # populate this list with best guess for each image
