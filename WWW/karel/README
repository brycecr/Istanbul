How to program in the Elimu Project:

You can test changes to the Karel Engine using karelEngineTest.html in the root directory. The code for the karel engine lives in the js directory. 

This project uses the codeMirror library for displaying sytax highlighted text.

Ask Chris (piech@cs.stanford.edu) if you would like to work on the HTML/backend of the page.

Have a nice day,
