							<strong>1. Earnest Spelling</strong>
						</p>
						The first functional spell checker was created in the early 1960s by Lester Earnest a professor in Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence lab. He wanted to create a system to recognize handwriting but realized that to do so, he also needed a spelling corrector! In this problem, we're going to look at how to model spelling correction as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).

						You are given a sentence, which is a sequence of $n$ (possibly misspelled) words 
                        $w_1, \cdots, w_n$, where each $w_i$ is a sequence of letters. You have a dictionary $D$ of possible words. 
                        Define the edit distance $Edit(w,w')$ as the minimum number of insertions, deletions, or replacements 
                        required to convert $w$ into $w'$. Furthermore, you have a function $Fluency(w, w', w'')$, which measures how likely the words $w, w', w''$ are to appear next to each other in that order. Your goal is to find a sequence of real words from the dictionary $t_1 , \cdots , t_n$ that minimizes the sum of the edit distances $Edit(t_i, w_i)$ plus the sum of $-Fluency(t_i, t_{i+1}, t_{i+2})$.

							<strong>2. Cancer Warning Signs</strong>
						</p>

						<p>One of the first uses of Bayesian networks was to model the transmission of genetic information from parent to child to better predict disease. In this problem, we will look at how inherited genetics affect breast cancer.</p>

                        <p>Every person has two "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele">alleles</a>" for each gene, one allele was passed from their mother and another from their father.</p>

                        <p>The presence of a damaged allele of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA1">BRCA1</a> gene has been found to be associated with increased risk for breast cancer. Let $B$ represent a damaged allele in BRCA1, and $b$ represent a normal functional BRCA1 allele. Unless an individual has two funcitonal allels ($bb$), they will be particularly susceptible to cancer. Both men and women can develop breast cancer, but men have a much lower probability.</p>


                        <p>Let $G_x$ denote the two BRCA1 allels for person $x$ (either $BB$, $Bb$, or $bb$). Let $C_x$ denote whether person $x$ will develop breast cancer (True or False). The baysian models bellow show three alternative representations of how the variables are related for two parents and one child.

                        <p>Partents transfer an allel to their child from there genotype with uniform probability, regardless of whether or not they have cancer. In other words, when a parent has a genotype $Bb$, then $B$ will be the allele they transfer to the child with probability 1/2 and $b$ will be the transferred allele with probability 1/2. When a parent has a genotype $BB$ or $bb$, the allele $B$ or $b$ respectively will be transferred with probability 1.

To find the model that best fits the data, we would enumerate every possible Bayesian network depicting relationships (either correlation or causality) among the 100 genes, calculate the probability for each network given the data (P(network i | data) for i in 1...n, and pick the one that scores the best -- we then say this network best describes reality.

							<strong>3. Jazz Improvisation</strong>

							Jazz is a celebration of the ecclectic, and as a genre it is relatively free of typical composational rules. As such it is a domain where computers are able to make creative contributions.</p>

                        <p>In this problem, you are going to write a problem that can improvize jazz music for a saxophone using markov chains. Assume you have a dictionary of notes $D$ = {C, E, E&#9837;, G, G&#9839;, B, <em>rest</em>} (this augmented scale is prevalent in John Coltrain songs). For simplicity we are going to assume each note is a quarter note.
