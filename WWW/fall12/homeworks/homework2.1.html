<b>Setup</b>.
In some languages such as Chinese, sentences are written without spaces between
the words, and an important first step in language processing is segmenting
sentences into words.
Formally, we have a set of characters (in English, these would be letters).
A sentence is a sequence of characters.
We also have a dictionary $D$, which is the set of words (each word is also a sequence of characters).
Given a sentence, the goal is to split the sentence into words from the dictionary.
For example, if $D = \{i, cat, dog, see, sleep, the\}$, then given the sentence <i>iseethecat</i>,
[<i>i, see, the, cat</i>] is a possible segmentation.

Suppose maximizing our utility corresponds to minimizing the number of words in the output segmentation.
Construct a deterministic state space model for this task.
What search algorithms (out of the following - DAG search, BFS, DFS, UCS, A*, Bellman-Ford) would produce a minimum cost path for your model?

If our goal is to maximize the number of words in the segmentation, revise the
state space model from above.  Which search algorithms work now?

<li class="part"> [3 point]
Instead of minimizing the number of words in the segmentation, suppose we had at our disposal a function $\text{Fluency}(w_1, w_2)$
which returns a number (either positive or negative) representing the compatibility of $w_1$ and $w_2$ being next to each other
(for example, $\text{Fluency}(an, cat)$ would be low and $\text{Fluency}(a, cat)$ would be high).
Suppose our utility function is the sum of the fluencies of adjacent words; formally,
if the segmentation produces words $w_1, \dots, w_n$, then the utility is $\sum_{i=2}^n \text{Fluency}(w_{i-1}, w_i)$.
Modify the state space model from above to find the most fluent segmentation.
