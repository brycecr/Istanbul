<b>Setup</b>: Suppose we have a set of cities $C$ which are connected by a set of roads $R$,
where traversing each road $(i,j) \in R$ requires paying $m_{i,j}$ dollars for the toll
and takes some time $t_{i,j}$.
Your goal is to go from city $c_\text{start} \in C$ to city $c_\text{goal} \in C$.
For a path $p$, let $\text{PathMoney}(p)$ be the total money paid in traversing $p$,
and let $\text{PathTime}(p)$ be the total time spent traversing $p$.

<li class="part"> [1 point]
Suppose such that one unit of time is worth $m$ dollars to you.
Define a utility function in terms of $\text{PathMoney}(p)$ and $\text{PathTime}(p)$.

Construct a state space model and specify an algorithm to maximize the utility function you described above.

<li class="part"> [1 point]
How does PathMoney and PathTime of the optimal path change as you vary $m$?

</li>

<li class="part"> [1 point]
Suppose you have a budget of $M$ dollars.
You're in a rush and would like to just minimize the amount of time you
spend on the road subject to the constraint that you can't spend more than $M$ dollars.
Write down your utility function in terms of PathMoney and PathTime.

<li class="part"> [4 points]
Construct a state space model and specify an algorithm to maximize the utility function you described above.
Hint: assume that all $m_{i,j}$ are non-negative integers.
How big is your state space?

justification for the consistency of your heuristic.
